				<div class="person-text" alt="Random Name">
					<p>As a frontend developer and UX-Designer I worked with designing new features for a customer
						portal
						and implementing them with Knockout.js and vue.js. Throughout 2019 I also took the lead on
						a UI/UX revamp of the portal. The purpose was to improve upon the problems that had been
						discovered since
						the first version of the UI was released. </p>
					<p> A set of problem areas to focus on were defined and a
						design process was started to iteratively reach a new design with the help of prototypes and
						user tests. Most of the initial ideation and UX-work was based on previous support issues and a
						series of UX
						interviews
						held at the start of the year. </p>

						interviewed the researchers, developed visualization prototypes and performed think aloud user
