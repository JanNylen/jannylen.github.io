					<h4>Frontend developer and UX-designer</h4>

				<p id="description">Hi, I am a UX-engineer from Northern Sweden. In 2017 I got my masters
					degree in Engineering in Interaction Technology and Design at Umea University. Since finishing my
					studies I have been working at <a style="color: #66cccc" href="https://www.cgi.com/en">CGI</a> with
					UI and UX in a cross functional product team.
				</p>

				<!--<p>I aim to constantly develop myself and my environment by looking for and experiencing new challenges within areas that are, or can become, a passion. I am a big proponent for analytical user centered design. While this might at times take a lot of time I feel it is necessary to reliably achieve successful results.

				<h4>Customer Support Portal</h4>
				<div class="person-text" alt="Random Name">
					<p>As a frontend developer and UX-Designer I worked with designing new features for a customer
						portal
						and implementing them with Knockout.js and vue.js. Throughout 2019 I also took the lead on
						a UI/UX revamp of the portal. The purpose was to improve upon the problems that had been
						discovered since
						the first version of the UI was released. </p>
					<p> A set of problem areas to focus on were defined and a
						design process was started to iteratively reach a new design with the help of prototypes and
						user tests. Most of the initial ideation and UX-work was based on previous support issues and a
						series of UX
						interviews
						held at the start of the year. </p>

						functionality and purpose of each of their services, worked on defining their user base, and
						iteratively designed and created a high-fidelity prototype in Figma to act as a reference for
						the team during development. </p>

					<p>Based on my interest for psychology and especially cognition I looked for a master thesis close

						of datasets that their research generated. During the thesis I studied their data, iteratively
						interviewed the researchers, developed visualization prototypes and performed think aloud user
						tests. </p>
